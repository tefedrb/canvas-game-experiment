# Game Title: Earthling
**Game Type: RPG**
**Game Premise: Humans vs a malicious homegrown AI**

A malicious machine learning algorithm created in the depths of the web has developed a conscious and secretly manufactured an army of physical machines to rid the planet of human beings. It's reasoning, of course, is that humans are destroying the planet and that for their own good the AI is intervening by trying to wipe out the majority of the human population... you know, the usual.

Most humans are no match for these metal-bound AI humanoids, however there are a select few who can harness sacred earthly forces... I think you see where this is going. 

You are one of a select few who have kept their power a secret to the majority of the population, except from those who still practice and maintain the ancient teachings - passed down strictly through oral tradition in fear of persecution. During the early ages of humanity there were civilizations who were more in-tune with those sacred earthy forces, and who developed a deep and robust methodology to help humans blossom and control that innate connection to the planet. Of course, because of jealousy, fear and pure greed, a faction of humans banded together to oppress those with more developed powers. Throughout the ages, that oppression insidiously became systemic in nature - embedded in institutions, popular culture, and subsequently the psyche of human beings - so much so that today there only remain a small fraction of the population who know that they have powers, and even fewer who have access to the ancient teachings that help develop and control them.

## Notes / Ideas:
    The ability for a character to accurately assess their opponents agility - this will help determine whether to brace for impact or attack.
